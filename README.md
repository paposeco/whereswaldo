# Where's Waldo game for The Odin Project

The purpose of this project was to learn to interact with a backend by making a photo tagging app. I implemented a Where's Waldo game where you have to identify 5 characters and used a Firebase database.

## Features

The users are anonymous, but will be asked for a name if their score is on the top 5 scores. The user identifies the characters by clicking on the image and selecting the appropriate character from a list.

If the user refreshes the page, the game continues where it was left off.

Due to the nature of the game, it isn't very mobile friendly since the image will be very small.

## Thoughts

Fun times. Learned a bit more about promises and how to interact with the backend. I considered doing the optional extension of adding more images, but decided to move on for now.
